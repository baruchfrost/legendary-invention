We will explore the following research questions:
1.	How did the stocks in each quartile perform over the 5-year period? Did any of the quartiles consistently outperform the others, or did the performance vary from year to year?
2.	What were the risks associated with investing in each of the quartiles? Did any quartile have a higher level of risk than the others?

The rough breakdown of tasks is the following:
1.	Acquire the data, clean the data, and bring the data into pandas.
2.	Categorize the data into the appropriate quartiles based on trading volumes
3.	Compare the performance of each quartile with the index as a whole with graphs to highlight the similarities/differences in risk and overall returns.
4.	Produce a written analysis based on the findings of the analysis
