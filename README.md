We explored the following research questions:
1.	How did the stocks in each quintile perform over the 4-year period (2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018)? Did any of the quintiles consistently outperform the others, or did the performance vary from year to year?
2.	What were the risks associated with investing in each of the quintiles? Did any quintile have a higher level of risk than the others?

The analysis involved the following tasks:
1.	Acquiring the data, cleaning the data, and bringing the data into pandas. Nick Latinovic helped us acquire a good data set.
2.	Categorizing the data into the appropriate quintiles based on trading volumes
3.	Comparing the performance of each quintile with graphs to highlight the similarities/differences in risk and overall returns.
4.	Producing a written analysis based on the findings of the analysis

The analysis is documented in the following Jupiter Notebook: Team1_Data_Analysis_SPX500.ipynb.
The data used in the analysis is in the following csv file: spx500_monthly_data_vol.csv.
